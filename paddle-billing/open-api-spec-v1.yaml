        Updates a product using its ID.

        Paddle does not upload product images to a CDN. For `image_url`, you should host images on an HTTPS server that's publicly accessible. We recommend using square images (`1:1` ratio).

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the updated product entity.

        Creates a new price.

        Prices describe how you charge for products. You must include a `product_id` in your request to relate this price to a product.

        If you omit the `quantity` object, Paddle automatically sets a minimum of `1` and a maximum of `100` for you. This means the most units that a customer can buy is 100. Set a quantity if you'd like to offer a different amount.

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the new price entity.

        Creates a new transaction.

        Transactions are typically created with the status of `draft` or `ready` initially:

        * Draft transactions have `items` against them, but don't have all of the required fields for billing. Paddle creates draft transactions automatically when a checkout is opened.
        * Paddle automatically marks transactions as `ready` when all of the required fields are present for billing. This includes `customer_id` and `address_id` for automatically-collected transactions, and `billing_details` for manually-collected transactions.

        The `collection_mode` against a transaction determines how Paddle tries to collect for payment:

        * Manually-collected transactions are for sales-assisted billing. Paddle sends an invoice to your customer when a transaction is `billed`. Payment is often by wire transfer.
        * Automatically-collected transactions are for self-serve checkouts. Paddle tries to collect using a payment method on file, or you may pass the transaction to a checkout to collect for payment.

        When a manually-collected transaction is marked as `billed` or an automatically-collected transaction is `completed`, Paddle automatically creates a related subscription for the items on the transaction.

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the new transaction entity.

        Use the `include` parameter to include related entities in the response.

        Previews calculations for one or more prices. Typically used for building pricing pages.

        You can provide location information when previewing prices. Paddle uses this to calculate tax. You can provide one of:

        * `customer_ip_address`: Paddle fetches location using the IP address to calculate totals.
        * `address`: Paddle uses the country and ZIP code (where supplied) to calculate totals.
        * `customer_id`, `address_id`, `business_id`: Paddle uses existing customer data to calculate totals. Typically used for logged-in customers.

        If successful, your response includes the data you sent with a `details` object that includes totals for the supplied prices. 

        Each line item includes `formatted_unit_totals` and `formatted_totals` objects that return totals formatted for the country or region you're working with, including the currency symbol.

        Previews a transaction without creating a transaction entity. Typically used for creating more advanced, dynamic pricing pages where users can build their own plans.

        Consider using [the preview prices operation](/api-reference/pricing-preview/preview-prices) for simpler pricing pages.

        You can provide location information to preview a transaction. Paddle uses this to calculate tax. You can provide one of:

        * `customer_ip_address`: Paddle fetches location using the IP address to calculate totals.
        * `address`: Paddle uses the country and ZIP code (where supplied) to calculate totals.
        * `customer_id`, `address_id`, `business_id`: Paddle uses existing customer data to calculate totals. Typically used for logged-in customers.

        When supplying items, you can exclude items from the total calculation using the `include_in_totals` boolean.

        By default, recurring items with trials are considered to have a zero charge when previewing. Set `ignore_trials` to `true` to ignore trial periods against prices for transaction preview calculations.

        If successful, your response includes the data you sent with a `details` object that includes totals for the supplied prices.

        Transaction previews do not create transactions, so no `id` is returned.

        Updates a transaction using its ID.

        You can update transactions that are `draft` or `ready`. `billed` and `completed` transactions are considered records for tax and legal purposes, so they can't be changed. You can either:

        * Create [an adjustment](/api-reference/adjustments/overview) to record a refund or credit for a transaction.
        * Cancel a `billed` transaction by sending a PATCH request to set `status` to `canceled`.

        The transaction `status` may only be set to `billed` or `canceled`. Other statuses are set automatically by Paddle. Set a manually-collected transaction to `billed` to mark it as finalized. This is essentially issuing an invoice. At this point, it becomes a legal record so you can't make changes to it. Paddle automatically assigns an invoice number, creates [a related subscription](/api-reference/subscriptions/overview), and sends it to your customer.

        When making changes to items on a transaction, send the complete list of items that you'd like to be on a transaction — including existing items. For each item, send an object containing `price_id` and `quantity`. Paddle responds with the full `price` object for each item. See: [Work with lists](/api-reference/about/lists)

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the updated transaction entity.

        Creates an adjustment for one or more transaction items.

        You may create adjustments for `billed` or `completed` transactions:

        * Where an adjustment is for a manually-collected transaction with the status of `billed` (an issued invoice), credit adjustments reduce the balance to pay on the invoice.
        * Where an adjustment is a refund, the total is returned to a customer's original payment method.

        You can't create credits for automatically-collected transactions. Paddle creates and manages credits for automatically-collected transactions when you make changes to the related subscription and choose to prorate.

        Refunds must be approved by Paddle. They're created with the status `pending_approval`, before moving to `approved` or `rejected`.

        Adjustments can apply to some or all items on a transaction. You'll need the Paddle ID of the transaction to create a refund or credit for,
        along with the Paddle ID of any transaction items (`details.line_items[].id`).

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the new adjustment entity.

        Returns a list of credit balances for each currency for a customer. Each balance has three totals:

        * `available`: total available to use.
        * `reserved`: total temporarily reserved for billed transactions.
        * `used`: total amount of credit used.

        Credit is added to the `available` total initially. When used, it moves to the `used` total.

        The `reserved` total is used when a credit balance is applied to a transaction that's marked as `billed`, like when working with an issued invoice. It's not available for other transactions at this point, but isn't considered `used` until the transaction is completed. If a `billed` transaction is `canceled`, any reserved credit moves back to `available`.

        The response is not paginated.

        Creates a new notification setting (notification destination).

        Pass an array of event type names to `subscribed_events` to say which events you'd like to subscribe to. Paddle responds with the full event type object for each event type.

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the new notification setting entity. Use the returned `endpoint_secret_key` for webhook signature verification.

        Updates a notification setting (notification destination) using its ID.

        When updating subscribed events, send the complete list of event types that you'd like to subscribe to — including existing event types. If you omit event types, they're removed from the notification setting.

        You only need to pass an event type name. Paddle responds with the full event type object for each event type.

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the updated notification setting entity.

        Deletes a notification setting (notification destination) using its ID.

        When you delete a notification setting, it's permanently removed from your account. Paddle stops sending events to your destination, and you'll lose access to all the logs for this notification setting.

        There's no way to recover a deleted notification setting. Deactivate a notification setting using the update notification setting operation if you'll need access to the logs or want to reactivate later on.

        Invoices are always created with the `status` as `draft`. This means they don't have an `invoice_number` and you can make changes to the invoice and its items.

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the new invoice entity.

        Issues a draft invoice, changing the `status` from `draft` to either:

        * `pending_acceptance`, where a customer hasn't yet accepted the Paddle merchant of record terms
        * `unpaid` otherwise

        At this point, Paddle:

        * assigns an `invoice_number`
        * sends a copy of the invoice to your customer and any `contacts` against the business on the invoice

        Issued invoices are considered a legal document, so you can't make any changes to them. Cancel an invoice and create another if you need to make changes.

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the invoice entity with the new status.

        Updates a subscription using its ID.

        When making changes to items on a subscription, you must include the `proration_billing_mode` field to tell Paddle how to bill for those changes. Paddle returns an error if this field is missing when sending `items`.

        Send the complete list of items that you'd like to be on a subscription — including existing items. If you omit items, they're removed from the subscription.

        For each item, send `price_id` and `quantity`. Paddle responds with the full price object for each price. If you're updating an existing item, you can omit the `quantity` if you don't want to update it.

        If successful, your response includes a copy of the updated subscription entity.

        Cancels a subscription using its ID.

        For active subscriptions, cancellation takes place at the end of a subscription billing period. If successful, your response includes a copy of the updated subscription entity with a `schedule_change` to say that the subscription should cancel at the end of the billing period. Its `status` remains the same until after the effective date of the scheduled change, at which point it changes to `canceled`.

        For paused subscriptions, cancellation takes place immediately. If successful, your response includes a copy of the updated subscription entity with the `status` of `canceled`.

        You cannot reactivate a canceled subscription.

        Pauses a subscription using its ID.

        To create an open-ended pause, send an empty request body. The subscription remains paused until you send a resume request.

        To set a resume date, include the `resume_at` field in your request. The subscription remains paused until the resume date, or until you send a resume request.

        Pauses take place at the end of a subscription billing period. If successful, your response includes a copy of the updated subscription entity with a `schedule_change` to say that the subscription should pause at the end of the billing period. Its `status` remains the same until after the effective date of the scheduled change, at which point it changes to `paused`.

        Resumes a paused subscription using its ID. Only `paused` subscriptions can be resumed. You cannot resume a `canceled` subscription.

        On resume, Paddle bills for a subscription immediately. Subscription billing dates are recalculated based on the resume date.

        If successful, Paddle returns a copy of the updated subscription entity. The subscription status is `active`, and billing dates are updated to reflect the resume date.

        Returns a transaction that you can pass to a checkout to let customers update their payment details. Only for subscriptions where `collection_mode` is `automatic`.

        The transaction returned depends on the status of the related subscription:

        * Where a subscription is `past_due`, it returns the most recent `past_due` transaction.
        * Where a subscription is `active`, it creates a new zero amount transaction for the items on a subscription.

        You can use the returned `checkout.url`, or pass the returned transaction ID to Paddle.js to open a checkout to present customers with a way of updating their payment details.

        Creates a new one-time charge for a subscription. Use to bill non-recurring items to a subscription. Non-recurring items are price entities where the `billing_cycle` is `null`.

        If successful, Paddle responds with the updated subscription entity. However, one-time charges aren't held against the subscription entity, so the charges billed aren't returned in the response.

        Once created, to get details of a one-time charge:

        * When created with `effective_from` as `next_billing_period`, get the subscription the charge was billed to and use the `include` query parameter with the `next_transaction` value.
        * When created with `effective_from` as `immediately`, list transactions and use the `subscription_id` query parameter with the subscription ID of the subscription the charge was billed to.

        Previews creating a one-time charge for a subscription without billing that charge. Typically used for previewing calculations before making changes to a subscription.

        One-time charges are non-recurring items. These are price entities where the `billing_cycle` is `null`.

        If successful, your response includes `immediate_transaction`, `next_transaction`, and `recurring_transaction_details` so you can see expected transactions for the changes.

            Except for percentage discounts, Paddle applies tax to discounts based on the line item `price.tax_mode`. If `price.tax_mode` for a line item is `internal`, Paddle removes tax from the discount applied.
